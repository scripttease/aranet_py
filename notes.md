See (tutorial)[https://davidhamann.de/2023/02/05/reading-aranet4-sensor-data-from-python/]

Find the specific list of which reading is which (here)[https://gist.github.com/ariccio/2882a435c79da28ba6035a14c5c65f22] on a GATT table.

I think I can't get readings because it has not been permitted in app.
